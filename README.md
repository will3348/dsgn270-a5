### steps
- Basicly, I used my assignment 4 as my landing page. 
- I created 2 other pages which Wine page and spirits page.
- I made a prototype from home page/navigtion/wine to wine page.(on-click,move in from left, ease in 500ms).
- Also, I made a prototype on home page/navigtion/wine. while hovering the 'WINE' will bolder and bigger.
- The other page is SPIRITS. Almost same idea, but different page contents.
- I added a button to SPIRITS page from my preset component.
